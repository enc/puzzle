README
======

The simple structure of the logic no data structre was created.
The Server type is just an empty shell to implement the helper
and give the code a little structure, since even starting the server requires
the main package to start.

The code is pretty generic in most parts, which is my pragmatic aproach. The pragmatism of Go is what I really enjoy.

Language
--------

On the server side I infer the language from the accepted types.
There are better means with Javascript on the client side.


Build
-----

```
gb build hello
bin/hello  # to start server
```


Projects
========
Building BigQuery Infrastructure
-------------------------------
In my last company we moved to a BigData Database. We decided for BigQuery.
I was building the datastructure and queries for the datateam.
Working with big scaled databases it follows different rules. I would enjoy
going into the details of BigQuery with you.

Rebuild ETL in Golang
---------------------
I learned Golang in order to enable BigData processing and introduced the language in
my old company. I fell in love with the new paradigmas of that language.

The well build concurrency allows to fine tune the parallel processing
in order support the requirements and usage.

Unfortunately my favorite projects are not public.
